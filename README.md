Simple jquery code assessment for a job interview.

The recruiter have given me a permission to put the completed assessment in a public repo


The code assessment uses Bootstrap, Jquery, SCSS, HTML

In order to run the example on your machine just download bootstrap 4, and also create an image folder in the root folder and put there 3 avatars images as you want, then change the img src= .. to point on the images you're using
